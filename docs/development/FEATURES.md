- **Home Automation:** Home Assistant, Node-RED
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate network diagrams

## API Rate Limiting Considerations

When implementing experiments, be mindful of rate limits:
- Early Access: 100 requests/minute
- Stable Release: 10,000 requests/minute

Implement:
- Request throttling
- Exponential backoff
- Caching strategies
- Batch operations where possible

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling:** Always handle API errors gracefully
2. **Logging:** Keep detailed logs of all API interactions
3. **Security:** Never expose API keys; use environment variables
4. **Testing:** Test with a small subset before scaling
5. **Documentation:** Document your findings and experiments
6. **Backups:** Backup configurations before making changes
