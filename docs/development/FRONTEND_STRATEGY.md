# Frontend Strategy - Historical Analysis & Unique Insights

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** January 2025
**Purpose:** Define frontend focus areas that complement (not duplicate) the UniFi WiFi app

---

## 🎯 Strategic Vision

**Build a historical analysis and insights platform that does what the UniFi app can't.**

The official UniFi WiFi app excels at:

- ✅ Real-time device status
- ✅ Current client connections
- ✅ Basic configuration
- ✅ Instant troubleshooting
- ✅ Mobile-first experience

**Our dashboard focuses on:**

- 📊 **Historical Analysis** - Long-term trends, patterns, and insights
- 🔍 **Deep Analytics** - Statistical analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting
- 📈 **Custom Reporting** - Flexible time ranges, exportable data
- 🚨 **Alert Intelligence** - Alert patterns, root cause analysis, alert fatigue reduction
- 📉 **Performance Trends** - Degradation detection, capacity planning
- 🔬 **Data Mining** - Correlations, patterns, predictive insights

---

## 🚫 What We DON'T Build (Already in UniFi App)

### Avoid Duplicating

1. **Real-time Device Management**

   - Device adoption/provisioning
   - Firmware updates
   - Real-time configuration changes
   - Reboot/restart actions
   - Port management

2. **Live Client Management**

   - Current connected clients
   - Block/unblock clients
   - Bandwidth limiting
   - Client reconnection

3. **Network Configuration**

   - SSID creation/editing
   - VLAN configuration
   - Firewall rules
   - Port forwarding
   - Guest network setup

4. **Mobile-First Features**
   - Push notifications for immediate issues
   - Quick device status checks
   - On-the-go management

**Strategy:** If the UniFi app does it well in real-time, we provide historical context and analysis instead.

```

---

### 3. Alert Intelligence System 🚨

**The UniFi app alerts you. We help you understand alert patterns.**

#### Features

**Alert Analytics**

- Alert frequency trends (are we getting more alerts over time?)
- Alert type distribution (pie chart: CPU alerts vs temperature vs offline)
- Mean time to acknowledge (MTTA) and resolve (MTTR)
- Alert correlation matrix (which alerts happen together?)
- Alert fatigue metrics (too many false positives?)

**Root Cause Analysis**

- "Device offline alerts preceded by high temperature alerts"
- Alert chain visualization (what led to this alert?)
- Common alert sequences
- Time-to-recurrence tracking

**Alert Pattern Recognition**

- "High CPU alerts always at 2am on Sundays" → maintenance?
- "Temperature alerts only in summer months" → cooling issue?
- "Memory alerts increasing 5% monthly" → memory leak?

**Alert Effectiveness**

- Which rules trigger most often?
- Which rules never trigger? (should we remove them?)
- False positive rate by rule
- Alert tuning recommendations

**Historical Alert Timeline**

- Visual timeline of all alerts with drill-down
- Group by device, type, severity
- Export alert history for compliance/reporting
- "Replay" alert storms to understand what happened

**Example Views:**

```
Alert Intelligence Dashboard
├─ Alert Frequency Trend (last 90 days)
├─ Top 10 Most Frequent Alerts (with fix suggestions)
├─ Alert Correlation Matrix
├─ MTTA/MTTR by Alert Type
├─ Alert Storm Detection (>10 alerts in 5 minutes)
└─ Rule Effectiveness Score
```

3. **Flexible Time Ranges** - User controls the time window
4. **Export Everything** - All data is exportable
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Summary → Details → Deep Analysis
6. **Performance Matters** - Handle years of data efficiently
7. **Complement Don't Duplicate** - If UniFi app does it, we don't

## 📖 Next Steps

1. ✅ Read this strategic document
2. ⏳ Review Phase 5.2 kickoff with this strategy in mind
3. ⏳ Start frontend with focus on historical data visualization
4. ⏳ Build charting library with time-series as primary use case
5. ⏳ Implement data export early (validate data liberation goal)
6. ⏳ Create analytics engine for anomaly detection
7. ⏳ Build alert intelligence dashboard
