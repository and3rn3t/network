# Migrating to Real Data - Complete! ✅

## Status: **Backend Now Serves Real UniFi Data**

The application has been updated to use real data from your UniFi controller instead of mock data.

## What Changed

### Backend API Updates

- ✅ **Devices API** (`/api/devices`) - Now queries `unifi_devices` + `unifi_device_status` tables
- ✅ **Clients API** (`/api/clients`) - Now queries `unifi_clients` + `unifi_client_status` with WiFi metrics
- ✅ **Analytics Page** - Now shows real WiFi optimization recommendations based on actual signal strength, speeds, and channels

### Data Available

Your database (`network_monitor.db`) contains:

- **6 Devices** (Access Points, Switches, etc.)
- **38 Clients** (Connected devices)
- **2,108 Device Metrics** (CPU, Memory, Temperature)
- **14,998 Client Metrics** (Signal, Speed, Satisfaction)
- **80 Collection Runs** (Historical data points)

## How to See Real Data

### 1. Backend is Already Running

The backend server (port 8000) is now serving real data from your UniFi controller.

### 2. Frontend Will Display Real Data

Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and you should see:

**Dashboard:**

- Real device count (6 devices)
- Real client count (38 clients)
- Network health score based on actual metrics
- Live data from WebSocket

**Devices Page:**

- List of your actual UniFi devices
- Real IP addresses, MAC addresses, models
- Current status (online/offline)
- Firmware versions

**Clients Page:**

- All 38 connected clients
- Real hostnames and IPs
- WiFi metrics (signal strength, TX/RX rates)
- Channel information

**Analytics Page:**

- Real WiFi optimization recommendations
- Clients with weak signals (<-70 dBm)
- Clients with slow speeds (<50 Mbps)
- Congested channels
- Specific recommendations per client

### 3. Keep Data Fresh

To continuously collect new data, run the collection script:

```powershell
# One-time collection
python collect_unifi_data.py

# Or set up scheduled collection (every 5 minutes)
# Add to Windows Task Scheduler or use a cron job
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Backend Health:**

   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
   ```

   Should return: `{"status": "ok"}`

2. **Check Device Data:**

   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/devices
   ```

   Should return your 6 devices with real data

3. **Check Client Data:**

   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/clients
   ```

   Should return your 38 clients with WiFi metrics

4. **Check Analytics:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/analytics/health-score
   ```
   Should return network health score

## What's Real vs. What's Not

### ✅ Now Using Real Data:

- Device list (models, IPs, status)
- Client list (names, IPs, MACs)
- WiFi metrics (signal, speed, channel)
- Network health calculations
- Analytics recommendations

### ⚠️ Still Need Setup:

- **Alert Rules** - Need to configure via Alerts page
- **Historical Trends** - Will populate as data is collected over time
- **User Management** - Default admin user exists, can add more

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see data:

1. **Check Database Path:**

   ```powershell
   python scripts\check_database.py
   ```

   Should show tables with row counts

2. **Verify Backend Connection:**

   - Make sure backend is running (port 8000)
   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Look at backend terminal for error messages

3. **Refresh Collection:**

   ```powershell
   python collect_unifi_data.py
   ```

   This will fetch latest data from UniFi controller

4. **Check UniFi Config:**
   Ensure `config.py` has correct credentials:
   ```python
   CONTROLLER_HOST = "your-udm-ip"
   CONTROLLER_USERNAME = "your-username"
   CONTROLLER_PASSWORD = "your-password"
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have real data:

1. **Explore the Analytics Page** - See WiFi optimization recommendations for your actual clients
2. **Set Up Alerts** - Configure rules for CPU, memory, temperature thresholds
3. **Monitor Historical Trends** - Check back after a few hours to see performance over time
4. **Test Device Actions** - Try rebooting a device, blocking a client, etc.

🎉 **Your UniFi Network Monitor is now live with real data!**
