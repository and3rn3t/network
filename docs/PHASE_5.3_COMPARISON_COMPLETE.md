# Phase 5.3 Advanced Features - Multi-Device Comparison

**Status**: ✅ Core Features Complete
**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Implementation Time**: ~30 minutes

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Device Comparison Page ✅

**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/Comparison.tsx`

**Features**:

- **Multi-device selection** - Add up to 6 devices for side-by-side comparison
- **Color-coded devices** - Each device gets a unique color for easy identification
- **Synchronized time ranges** - All charts share the same time period
- **Device management** - Add/remove devices dynamically with visual tags
- **Export functionality** - Download comparison data as JSON

**User Experience**:

```
1. Select devices from dropdown
2. See them added as colored tags
3. View all metrics compared in synchronized charts
4. Export data for external analysis
```

### 2. Comparison Chart Component ✅

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/charts/ComparisonChart.tsx`

**Features**:

- **Multi-line charts** - Show all devices on same chart with distinct colors
- **Smart data alignment** - Merges metrics by timestamp
- **Responsive tooltips** - Hover to see all device values at that time
- **Adaptive time formatting** - Shows HH:mm for short ranges, MM/dd HH:mm for longer
- **Empty state handling** - Clear messages when no data available

**Metrics Compared**:

- CPU Usage (%)
- Memory Usage (%)
- Network Download (Mbps)
- Network Upload (Mbps)

### 3. Navigation Integration ✅

**Changes Made**:

- Added "Device Comparison" menu item to sidebar
- Used SwapOutlined icon for comparison feature
- Integrated route into app routing system

## 📊 How It Works

### Component Architecture

```
Comparison Page
├── Device Selection (Select component)
│   ├── Filter available devices
│   ├── Add device with color assignment
│   └── Display as colored tags
│
├── Time Range Selector
│   └── Synchronized across all charts
│
├── Comparison Charts (4 metrics)
│   ├── ComparisonChart for CPU
│   ├── ComparisonChart for Memory
│   ├── ComparisonChart for Network RX
│   └── ComparisonChart for Network TX
│
└── Export Functionality
    └── JSON download with all metrics
```

### Data Flow

```
1. User selects devices → selectedDevices state updates
2. React hooks fetch metrics for each device (always 6 hooks)
3. Hooks return data/loading/error states
4. ComparisonChart merges metrics by timestamp
5. Recharts renders multi-line chart
6. User can export combined data as JSON
```

### Key Implementation Details

**Fixed Number of Hooks** (React Rules):

```typescript
// Always call 6 hooks (even if not used)
const metrics1 = useDeviceMetrics(selectedDevices[0]?.id, timeRange.hours);
const metrics2 = useDeviceMetrics(selectedDevices[1]?.id, timeRange.hours);
// ... up to metrics6
```

This ensures hooks are called the same number of times on every render, following React's rules.

**Device Color Assignment**:

```typescript
const DEVICE_COLORS = [
  "#1890ff", // Blue
  "#52c41a", // Green
  "#fa8c16", // Orange
  "#722ed1", // Purple
  "#eb2f96", // Pink
  "#13c2c2", // Cyan
];
```

**Data Merging**:

```typescript
// Create map of timestamps
const timeMap = new Map<string, any>();

// For each device, add metrics to timestamp entries
data.forEach(({ device, metrics }) => {
  metrics.forEach((metric) => {
    const time = metric.recorded_at;
    if (!timeMap.has(time)) {
      timeMap.set(time, { time });
    }
    timeMap.get(time)[device.name] = metric.metric_value;
  });
});
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Compare Two Devices

1. Navigate to **Device Comparison** in sidebar
2. Select first device (e.g., "UniFi Switch 24 Port")
3. Select second device (e.g., "UniFi Gateway")
4. Charts automatically update showing both devices
5. Hover over chart to see exact values at any point

### Analyze 6 Devices

1. Add up to 6 devices to comparison
2. Each gets a unique color
3. See all devices overlaid on same charts
4. Identify patterns, outliers, or correlations

### Export Comparison Data

1. Click "Export Comparison" button (appears when 2+ devices selected)
2. JSON file downloads with:
   - Timestamp of export
   - Time range information
   - All device names and colors
   - Complete metrics for all devices

Example export structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T23:50:00.000Z",
  "timeRange": "Last 24 Hours",
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Device 1",
      "color": "#1890ff",
      "metrics": [
        {
          "recorded_at": "2025-10-18T00:00:00Z",
          "metric_value": 45.2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Header** - Title + Export button (when applicable)
2. **Controls** - Device selector + Time range
3. **Selected Devices** - Colored tags showing current selection
4. **Status Alert** - Info about what's being compared
5. **Charts** - 4 synchronized comparison charts

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Full-width controls and charts stack vertically
- **Tablet**: 2-column layout for controls
- **Desktop**: Optimized spacing, side-by-side controls

### Empty States

| Situation           | Message                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| No devices selected | "Use the dropdown above to add devices"          |
| 1 device selected   | "Add at least one more device to see comparison" |
| No data available   | "No {metric} data found for selected devices"    |

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. React Hooks Rules

**Problem**: Can't call hooks conditionally or in loops
**Solution**: Always call 6 useDeviceMetrics hooks, pass undefined for unused slots

### 2. Type Safety

**Problem**: Device ID is number, but we use string for selected devices
**Solution**: Convert device.id.toString() when adding, maintain string throughout component

### 3. Data Synchronization

**Problem**: Different devices may have metrics at different times
**Solution**: Merge by timestamp into map, use connectNulls in Recharts

### 4. Color Management

**Problem**: Need consistent colors for same device across renders
**Solution**: Assign color when device is added, store in state

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Manual testing scenarios:

- [ ] Add single device → see "add one more" message
- [ ] Add 2 devices → see all 4 charts with both lines
- [ ] Add 6 devices → see full comparison, dropdown disables
- [ ] Remove device → charts update immediately
- [ ] Change time range → all charts reload with new data
- [ ] Export JSON → file downloads with correct structure
- [ ] Empty state → appropriate messages display
- [ ] Loading state → spinners show while fetching
- [ ] Error state → error messages display if API fails
