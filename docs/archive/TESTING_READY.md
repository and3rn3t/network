## 🚀 How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Update Your Controller Info

Edit `config.py` (lines 22-27):

```python
CONTROLLER_HOST = "192.168.1.10"      # ← Your controller's IP
CONTROLLER_PORT = 8443                 # ← Usually 8443 or 443
CONTROLLER_USERNAME = "admin"          # ← Your username
CONTROLLER_PASSWORD = "your_password"  # ← Your password
CONTROLLER_SITE = "default"            # ← Usually "default"
API_TYPE = "local"                     # ← Keep as "local"
```

**Don't have a controller?** That's OK - the test framework is ready when you do!

### Step 2: Run Quick Test

```powershell
python quick_test_unifi.py
```

**Takes 5 seconds.** Shows if everything works.

### Step 3: Run Full Test (Optional)

```powershell
python test_unifi_integration.py
```

**Takes 2-5 minutes.** Tests all operations interactively.
