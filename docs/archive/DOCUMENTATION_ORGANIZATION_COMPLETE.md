# Documentation Cleanup & Organization - Complete

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Task**: Documentation consolidation and organization
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up, consolidated, and organized all 92 documentation files into a logical, maintainable structure with comprehensive guides for users, developers, and future contributors.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Organized Directory Structure ✅

**Before**:

- 92 files in flat `docs/` directory
- Mix of guides, references, progress reports, completion docs
- Difficult to find relevant documentation
- No clear organization

**After**:

```
